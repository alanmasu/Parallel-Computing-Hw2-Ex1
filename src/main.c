    Assignment 2 - Exercise 1:
      The first exercise consists of implementing a parallel matrix multiplication program using OpenMP.
      The program must be able to handle efficiently both dense and sparse matrices of real numbers. The
      tasks to be performed are:
      - T1: Serial matrix multiplication:
            Implement a serial matrix multiplication algorithm. You will need to define a matMul function
            that takes two input matrices, A and B, and returns their product, C. Be sure to validate the
            compatibility of the matrices for multiplication.
      - T2: Parallel matrix multiplication:
            Parallelize matrix multiplication using OpenMP. Create a matMulPar function that takes the
            same inputs as the sequential version and parallelizes the algorithm. Experiment with different
            OpenMP directives to improve performance. Explore different parallelization strategies to find
            the most efficient implementation.
      - T3: Performance analysis:
            Evaluate the performance and scalability of your parallel implementation of matrix multiplication. Calculate speedup and efficiency gains for different matrix sizes and number of threads.
            Consider for this task the time of the routine and compute the FLOPS as performance metrics. Identify potential bottlenecks or problems and propose optimizations to help
            solve them.
